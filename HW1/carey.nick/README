Assignment: "Homework 1: Search"

Listing of Files:
./src/edu/jhu/nick/cs335/hw1/PathSearch.java
  - This is the main driver of the program. It parses cmd line arguments and 
    selects the appropriate search algorithm to use. It runs the search and 
    outputs program results

./src/edu/jhu/nick/cs335/hw1/SearchAlgorithm.java
  - This is an abstract class that each of DFS.java, BFS.java, and AStar.java implement

./src/edu/jhu/nick/cs335/hw1/GridSpaceObject.java
  - This is an object used to represent a tile in the map

./src/edu/jhu/nick/cs335/hw1/BFS.java
  - Breadth First Search algorithm implementation

./src/edu/jhu/nick/cs335/hw1/DFS.java
  - Depth First Search algorithm implementation

./src/edu/jhu/nick/cs335/hw1/AStar.java
  - A* algorithm implementation


How to Build and Run:
  - To build:
    - type 'make' in the ./src directory
  - To run:
    - type 'make ARGS="../data/mapX.txt [algorithm]" run -C src' in the ./ directory
      where X is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,or 8 and [algorithm] is BFS, DFS, or A*
    - OR, edit the run.sh file as mentioned above, and execute

Approximate Runtimes are listed in the table included in the ./doc/Written.pdf

Reflections:

I am a second year masters student and I spend ~18 hours on this assignment and I did not nearly
complete everything required of me. I think it is useful
to implement DFS, BFS, A*, and other search algorithms, but I believe the amount of busywork 
present in this assignment is far too much.  The majority of the time I spent on this assignment was
setup, Object Oriented Design, polish, and other non-AI related tasks.  I would like to learn and practice
AI, and I would like the homework to help me learn AI-related subjects. I think my grade is now 
going to suffer because I spent too much time on non-AI setup tasks,
which did not allow me to get to the implementation of the AI-search algorithms.
In the future I would suggest a much more complete code scaffold to be provided.
