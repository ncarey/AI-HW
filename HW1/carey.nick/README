1. Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This README is part of a scaffold provided for students taking JHU's Artificial
Intelligence class.  It is intended to give students an idea of the directory
structure they are expected to use when submitting assignments for this class.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All code resides in the src/ subdirectory, which also contains a Makefile that
can build and run the code.  As a convenience, the top level directory also
contains shellscripts which call `make`.

You are not required to use Make; so long as your shell scripts do what they're
supposed to, you can write them any way you like.


The program here is a simple HelloWorld prorgam, intended primarily to
demonstrate proper use of packages and directories.  The Makefile is fairly
flexible (though intentionally on the simple side), and is intended to be an
example of one way to manage a Java codebase without using an IDE for those who
prefer to use command-line tools.

To build the program, cd to the src/ subdirectory, and do `make`; to run the
program, do `make run`; and to build the JavaDocs, do `make docs`.  The binary
class files will be put in the bin/ subdirectory, and the html document files
will be put in the doc/ subdirectory.

See the assignment PDF for details about what you are expected to submit.
