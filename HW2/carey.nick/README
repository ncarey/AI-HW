1. Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This README is part of a scaffold provided for students taking JHU's Artificial
Intelligence class.  It is intended to give students an idea of the directory
structure they are expected to use when submitting assignments for this class.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All code resides in the src/ subdirectory, which also contains a Makefile that
can build and run the code.  As a convenience, the top level directory also
contains shellscripts which call `make`.  The run.sh script also passes any
command line arguments given to it along to the Java program, in case you want
your Java program to make use of command line arguments.

You are not required to use Make for your homework; so long as your shell
scripts do what they're supposed to, you can write them any way you like (see
assignment PDF for details).


The program code included here implements all of the game logic for Konane, so
that students can concentrate on their game-playing agents, rather than trying
to get the rules of the game right.  You are free to make whatever use of this
code you like in doing your assignment (including none), but the intent is that
the code in the board/ subdirectory should not require modification.  The
main() function in Konane.java is pretty basic, so you may want to improve or
re-write it; as always, the interface design is up to you.

The code in the players/ subdirectory is the code which you are expected to
modify.  Currently, the only Player type that does anything is HumanPlayer,
which is a simple example of how you can have a human play the game (feel free
to modify or re-write this class if you wish, but it may already be sufficient
for your needs).  The other classes, MinimaxPlayer and AlphaBetaPlayer, are
effectively empty, and you will need to fill them in correctly.  This is the
heart of the assignment, and can be done however you want.  You may also want
to create some additional classes (particularly if you are in the 400 level),
which is fine; again, you can do whatever you want with the scaffolding so long
as the program you turn in works correctly.


To build the program, cd to the src/ subdirectory, and do `make`; to run the
program, do `make run`; and to build the JavaDocs, do `make docs`.  The binary
class files will be put in the bin/ subdirectory, and the html document files
will be put in the doc/ subdirectory.

See the assignment PDF for details about what you are expected to submit.
